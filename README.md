# Student-Management-System
The student management systems designed to replace the existing version which was in use for a long time, since then the business has grown and the system has failed to keep up with the needs. Thus, a new system was developed with an improved user interface, faster response time, new data points and analytical features. As well as the task of developing the system, I was in charge of deployment which involved onsite installation and conducting training sessions with the staff of 5 branches in Bangkok. As for the 2 branches in Chiang-Mai the sessions was conducted through remote technology. During this time, I was in close contact with the users, to provide technical support as well as adding new features.
